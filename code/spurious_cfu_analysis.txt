#Analysis pipeline for figuring out if the mice actually had cdiff or not
# Kaitlin 1/18/17

#The problem: we have several mice that have low or no histopathology, low or no toxin, but high CFU
#We need to figure out if these are actually infected with cdiff (persistant/asymptomatic) or if there was a plating error
#A secondary problem is that there are several "severe" or moderate histo mice that also have low or no toxin and high CFU
#A tertiary problem is that we did not observe any colonization resistance in any of these mice, which might be expected

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#to first look at "mild" mice:
#First approach was to look at the Clostridium_X1 OTUs and look at specific sequences
#To do this, ran the following mothur commands on the gf_all dataset as it still contained Clos.11

bin.seqs(list=gf_all.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.pick.an.unique_list.list, count=gf_all.final.count_table, fasta=gf_all.final.fasta, label=0.03)

classify.seqs(fasta=gf_all.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.pick.an.unique_list.0.03.fasta, reference=trainset9_032012.pds.fasta, taxonomy=trainset9_032012.pds.tax, processors=8)

get.lineage(taxonomy=gf_all.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.pick.an.unique_list.0.03.pds.wang.taxonomy, taxon=Bacteria(100);Firmicutes(100);Clostridia(100);Clostridiales(100);Peptostreptococcaceae(100);Clostridium_XI(100);, fasta=gf_all.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.pick.an.unique_list.0.03.fasta)

#(did nick pick this sequence from the counts file? and how did he know which taxon to pick?
# M04695_12_000000000-ARPWD_1_1101_8481_6864)
# did he pick it from the counts file?

#Then I looked for the mild cages in the fastas... and blasted 

#the most commonly found C11 OTU sequence was this: 
#BLASTed main sequence we IDed as cdiff M04695_12_000000000-ARPWD_1_1101_8481_6864
#BLASTs with 100% identity to cdiff, so does 14654 and 14658 sequence

#BLASTs of sequences found in mild cages: (need to make sure mild cages arent also in 100% bin)
#LINE- mild- one sample-  DA001146- BLASTed and got 97% identity to cdiff

#NP2- mild- DA001134- BLASTed and 

#I mean so they're all 97% similar to each other. but that's because we set that as our cut off
#so does that really tell us much? besides we can do the negative, look for all cages that are mild and if no cages have this OTU, false
#or should we be looking for the 100% similar ones? 

#cage by cage analysis. mild cages: 430: infected, 23858 is 96% (99% terrisporobacter), has NP1 and 430, 23853 has pretty much every sample, inlcuding NP2, OUT2 (only one NP2, OUT2 is in) 96% ID
#so maybe that OTU is a background OTU. it is in all of the mice, not 100% ID to cdiff and could also look like it on a plate i suppose

#23858 and 6864 are highest in NumRep for whole table. So either they are different species or we dont have cdiff removed for the modeling 



#the 96% ID sequence is 99% ID to Terrisporobacter petrolearius. so almost definitely a contaminant then. hmm. 
# in that case we should check that severe mice dont have a bloom of this.

#Also lots of the mice have the 100% OTU present on day 0??

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#so for moderate mice, they're mostly split on toxin/histopath
#may be consistent with what Anna sometimes sees in relapse model, this is after 10days

#for severe mice, they have the most toxin, at the earliest time points. except for 578
#so maybe i need to go and look cage by cage to confirm colonization for all 0 toxin points

#there are severe cages that only have 23853!!! Like IN1. so now I am convinced that this may be a disease OTU (weight loss) and not just contamination? in which case we need to remove it from our model

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

Meeting with Anna and her advice, 1/19:

-Can't use D1 or D2 histopath and compare it to day 10, literally a week later, possible recovery
- what about comparing the D10 to each other? range in severity, OTUs
- Sort of reckless what strain she chose, hasn't been characterized in mouse model so we don't know really what is normal, what is unusual
- high CFU but low pathology- by day 10 could have recovered. don't be so suspicious
- Toxin assay doesnt measure binary toxin. Thats what this strain has. so some argument could be made about there being that and us not measuring it
- the cdiff OTUs are different OTU numbers
-day 0 they have cdiff?!?!?! but not donors?! by 16S. but we might not be able to trust Day 0 CFU, cant find anywhere alyx counted for it
		* some donors do, and found alyx's notes for Day 0

So what CAN we answer:
-D1/D2, AUC , wt loss- predict D1/D2 from D0
- compare D0 to donor
-Descriptive stuff
- cant predict enddate histopath, or at least not 1 and 10 together

Possible structure:
1) Description of outcome, toxin and CFU, with caveats 
2) some mice died- these had severe histopath
3) Diversity on day 0, day 10, day of euth
4) only take day10 histo, regroup mild/med/severe can we predict outcome then? can you predict D10 histo from D10 OTUS?
5) wt loss is out, toxin doesnt correlate, so we can have a new definiton of persistent/severe, cite precedent in literature
6) plot microbiome of D10, diversity of D10, model of D10
7) Did D10 predictive OTUs match D0 predictive OTUs? Maybe? 

Concentrate on this study now as a disease model 

Search for Cdiff OTUs in donor and water controls 
Lots of caveats. organize these thoughts later.

There are some donors with 16S sequences clustering into Clostridium XI, and some of those mice come from those donors, but also some of them do not and some that come from those donors do not have any sequences detected.
But to look further into this, to see what was plated on day 0 I looked back into the notebook and notes from the experiments.
It appears that all mice were plated regularly but only recorded when C difficile colonies were detected or daily post C difficile challenge.
	So there were no record of CFU for day 0 but for some there were yes/no for colonies or notes stating that the cage has C difficile or the days which a mouse in the cage had detectable C difficile in their stool.
