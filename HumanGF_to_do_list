Cdiff sequence analysis
X	which samples have the cdiff seqeunce
X		what is the relative abundance in those samples?
X			only ones significantly above mock are one set of mice
x				look into donor for sequences
X					No donors have high Peptostreptococcus
X						Highest is 3% but in donor w/o CDI
X						Donors w/CDI had 0, 0.2 and 0.03% relative abundances
X					No sequences map to C diff 630 with high identity
				> either remove group with high (10%) c diff on day 0 or discuss
X		what other bacteria map to the cdiff 16s v4 sequence
X			none - cdiff consensus only maps to cdiff

Rerun donor samples through mothur
X	inocula and cdiff strain donors
X	rerun mothur with the hmp mock

Concerns about the C diff 16S V4 sequences in the mock/day7/day0 samples and higher error rate (0.21%)
    Based on previous tests of the donor samples we are confident they did not have C diff present
    So most of these errors are likely due to some sort of contamination
        Suspect either sequencer carryover or PCR contamination
        What to do
			Are DA samples still available?
			Can we determine which C difficile is in our sample?
			Check if genomic DNA is still in freezer
			Could recheck error rate of exp samples w/o S96 which had lower seqeuncing depth
			Although looks fairly similar to other three
			Which donors have C difficile present on day 0?
