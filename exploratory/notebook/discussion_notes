	Proteobacteria associated with worse outcomes of toxin production, high clinical score and severe CDI. Generally, this group consists of many populations with the potential to drive pathogensis given the right environmental conditions.

While we did not use Il10 mice, it is possible the bacterial communtity differences in these human fecal community colonized mice XXXXXXXXXX, as H hepaticus requires microbiome to develop colitis, while only present in a few models,

			for cdiff to colonize and have worse disease

### not included in initial draft

Caveats
	no communities were able to become colonization resistance
		FMT then challenge with C difficile one week later and no colonization
			https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232072181_Barrier_Effect_of_Normal_Microbiota_Against_Clostridium_difficile_may_be_Influenced_by_Drugs_Devoid_of_Antibiotic_Activity
		Effect of only two weeks for colonization?
			Immune priming
			immature mucus layer
				Mucus development - might take 4-8 weeks
	isolates largely 027
	did not try same other isolates across multiple communities
		have genomes?
	no temporal aspect of clinical score so unsure if homeostasis
	histology slide imaging?
