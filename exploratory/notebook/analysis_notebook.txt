Returning to the GF-human microbiota project

Refreshing myself on where we were and what to do
Two issues that came up
	1. C difficile sequences in day 0/donor samples
	Based on analysis of data from more recent experiments, we saw the presence of cdiff sequences around/below 1% in samples prior to challenge, so the only samples of concern are LINE cages and are removed from analysis

	2. Multiple inocula samples were sequences
			Original donor samples were sequenced on 454 V35
			donor and inocula samples were sequenced on a separate 16S run
			A few were sequenced with the rest of the experimental samples, but only DA00581 was used
		Differences between 454 and 16S seem to be anaerobic shifts, which could have possibly occured during the inoculation steps.
		Option 1: Use samples sequenced via 16S together, since those are closer to what was used and we cannot be sure there is a shift in the microbes and if that shift was present at the time of inoculation or not
		Option 2: Use 454 sequences since are least likely to have any changes frm the donor and use them to describe the donor and not make comparisons to the mice
		Option 3: Use both, one to describe the donor (supplement?) and one to describe the inocula
			Obtain all sequencing files
				X - Donor 16S - 16S sequenced in 2016, 
						based on emails with Shayna and Kaitlin, appears to be from the donor aliquots
						does not include other communities cdiff was isolated from (299, 395, and 458)
						sequenced by core August 2016, in kaitlins dir sept 2016 btu dont see any fastqs in any of her dir in the locker
							not in and schloss or schubert dir
						contacted kaitlin and she was able to locate them and shared them with me
							contains all the samples used as fmt but not the communtities the cdiff strains came from
				X - Donor Source Sample 454 - originally sequenced for Shubert et al 2014
				X - Sample 16S - 16S sequenced in 2015
						located /nfs/locker/microbio-schloss-data/alyx/humanGF_2015.tgz
						not all donors in this dataset
			Resequence ERIN samples (donor source)
				Found - DA00430 DA00431 DA00578 DA00581 DA00810 DA00884 
				Found - DA00953 DA01134 DA01324 DA10027 DA10034 DA10093 DA10148
				Found - DA00299 DA00395 DA00458 Cdiff isolate donors
				Found - DA01146 DA00810 - groups removed from analysis
				DA00369	None in tube
				DA01245 Did not find
				DA10082 Did not Find
		Option 4: Use donor samples resequenced together from 2016
			Obtained sequence data from run in 2016 which we reseqeunced the donor samples from stool
				

Start analysis with cleaning metafile
	tidy data - tidy_raw_data.R
		add note on why day -7 was removed (only available for INA and OUTA)
		add note on why P2/DA00810 was removed (donor did not give permission for future studies)
		remove AMS (not from DA sample set)
		leave cecum in (only sample for some of the mice which died early)

Rerun mothur with updated files file
	remove AMS, DA00810, DA01146, D-7 from files file
	remove donor/inocula samples since incomplete
	add resequenced complete set of donor samples

CFU
>	quantify colonization rate
		previously tried to measure slope but also need to take delayed colonization into account
		day CFU > 10^6?

modeling
>	include PCA coordinates and diversity metrics
>	use precision/recall for early death since imbalanced
