Returning to the GF-human microbiota project
Refreshing myself on where we were and what to do
Two issues that came up
	1. C difficile sequences in day 0/donor samples
>
	2. Multiple inocula samples were sequences
			Original donor samples were sequenced on 454 V35
			donor and inocula samples were sequenced on a separate 16S run
			A few were sequenced with the rest of the experimental samples, but only DA00581 was used
		Differences between 454 and 16S seem to be anaerobic shifts, which could have possibly occured during the inoculation steps.
		Option 1: Use samples sequenced via 16S together, since those are closer to what was used and we cannot be sure there is a shift in the microbes and if that shift was present at the time of inoculation or not
		Option 2: Use 454 sequences since are least likely to have any changes frm the donor and use them to describe the donor and not make comparisons to the mice
>		Option 3: Use both, one to describe the donor (supplement?) and one to describe the inocula
			Obtain all sequencing files
				X - Inocula 16S
				X - Donor Source Sample 454 - 
				X - Sample 16S - located /nfs/locker/microbio-schloss-data/alyx/humanGF_2015.tgz

Start analysis with cleaning metafile
	already started make_HumanCdGF_metadata_file.R
>		check to make sure not eliminating samples when subsetting to match meta and shared
>		add note on why day -7 was removed (only available for INA and OUTA)
>		add note on why P2/DA00810 was removed
>		remove AMS
>		leave cecum in (only sample for some of the mice which died early)

Rerun mothur with updated files file
>	remove AMS, P2, D -7 from files file

CFU
>	quantify colonization rate
		previously tried to measure slope but also need to take delayed colonization into account
		day CFU > 10^6?

modeling
>	include PCA coordinates and diversity metrics
>	use precision/recall for early death since imbalanced
