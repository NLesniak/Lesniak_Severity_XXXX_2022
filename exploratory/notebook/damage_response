Damage-response framework
	theory of microbial pathogenesis
	pathogenesis is outcome of interaction between host and microbe, each contributing to outcome (host damage)
		all contribute to virulence/pathogenicity
	1 - microbial pathogenesis requires host and microbe
	2 - host damage is outcome
	3 - damage results from host and or microbe
	pathogen - microbe with potential to cause disease in host
	virulence - relative capacity to cause host damage (relative to control strain/condition)
	clinical disease - host damage passes threshold of host homeostasis
	infection - acquisition of microbe not illness

	infection leads to either elimination or colonization (presence with low host damage)
		colonization leads to either commensalism (benecial or no damage) or disease (clinical symptoms from damage)
			disease can lead to commensalism, latency, or chronic/death
