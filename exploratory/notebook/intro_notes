Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infections have been increasing in incidence and severity for the past two decades. C. difficile, first identified in 1931, wasn't categorized as a pathogen until the late 1970s after it was determined to be the driver of antibiotic-associated psuedomembranous colitis following the introduction of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the early 2000s CDI became more problematic with increasing incidences, severity and death. People colonized with C. difficile can experience a range of disease severities from asymptomatic to mild diarhea to toxic megacolon and death. CDI is primarily treated with an antibiotic, either metronidazole or vancomycin depending on CDI severity, but can also be treated with cesation of other antibiotics for milder cases or with a fecal microbiota transplation for CDI cases recalitrant to antibiotics.

CDI disease incidences and severity have been connected to aspects of antibiotic use, C. difficile strain, and host factors. Since the first identification of C. difficile other more hypervirulent strains have emerged, such as ribotype 027. 
	Severity
		3M cases/yr
		1/3 of infected patients develop disease, 3% become fullminant which account for all serious complications
		Antibiotic associated diarrhea / Asymptomatic carriage / Colitis / Pseudomembrance formation / Fulminant colitis / Recurrent
		Treatment tailored to severity
	Antibiotic - colonization varition
		antibiotic use leads to susceptility

	Strain type - toxic/non-toxic variation
		Toxin A and B production
			bind to and damage human colonic epithelial cell
		fluoroquinolon resistance
		binary toxin production
		tcd C - mutation in negative regulator of toxin txn
	Host factors - humoral immune response important fator in duration and severity
		antibody
			antitoxin IgG antibody production and timing
			IgA
		toxin receptor density
		innate response - neutrophil infiltration
		severe CDI associated with elevated peripheral white blood cell count and creatine
	Often assumed effect of strain is fixed and variation when all varaibles are constant are written off as experimental or human error, but is that necessarily true?
		"C. difficile strains with varied disease-causing potentials" 
	we have examined strain severity
		theriot - cef mice + 1 of 4 strains - control mouse to reduce varibility in strain

	appropriately treat severity of CDI
		currently vanc or fidax but metro may be sufficient

	The ability to identify patients at increased risk for severe disease or mortality at the time of diagnosis of C. difficile infection (CDI) would allow clinicians to effectively allocate disease modifying therapies. 
	in a study of two cohorts consisting of 156 and 272 unique CDI cases, of the 23 all-cause mortality cases, 10 of the patients (43.5%) did not meet IDSA severity criterion at time of diagnosis
	mouse model of severity used weight loss, histolopathologic damage and "clinical severity"
